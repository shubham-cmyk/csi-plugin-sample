# Sample CSI Plugin

This is a sample Container Storage Interface (CSI) plugin implemented in Go. The plugin provides basic storage functionality for containers and can be used as a starting point for building custom storage solutions.

## Code Structure

The codebase is organized into the following directories and files:

- `Dockerfile`: Contains instructions to build the CSI plugin as a Docker image.
- `logger/`: A custom logger package used for logging errors and info messages.
  - `log.go`: The main logger implementation file.
- `manifest/`: Contains Kubernetes YAML configuration files for deploying the CSI plugin.
  - `serviceAccount.yaml`: Defines the ServiceAccount resource for the CSI plugin.
  - `storageClass.yaml`: Defines the StorageClass resource to provision volumes using this CSI plugin.
  - `clusterRole.yaml`: Defines the ClusterRole resource with necessary permissions for the CSI plugin.
  - `clusterRoleBinding.yaml`: Binds the ClusterRole to the ServiceAccount.
  - `controller-plugin.yaml`: Contains configuration specific to your controller plugin deployment, such as StatefulSet, Service, etc.
  - `secret.yaml`: Defines a Kubernetes Secret that may store sensitive information required by your CSI plugin (e.g., credentials).
- `pkg/driver/`: Contains core implementation files of the CSI plugin.
  - `driver.go`: Main driver implementation file that initializes and starts the gRPC server.
  - `identity_service.go`: Implements identity-related RPCs in the CSI spec, such as GetPluginInfo, GetPluginCapabilities, and Probe.
  - `controller_service.go`: Implements controller-related RPCs in the CSI spec, such as CreateVolume, DeleteVolume, ControllerPublishVolume, etc.
  - `node_service.go`: Implements node-related RPCs in the CSI spec, such as NodeStageVolume, NodeUnstageVolume, NodePublishVolume, etc.

At root level:

- `main.go`: Entry point of this application that sets up and starts the driver service
- `go.mod` and `go.sum` : Go module files containing dependencies information.

### Building the CSI Plugin

To build the CSI plugin, run:

```sh
go build -o sample-csi-plugin main.go
```

### Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for the CSI plugin, run:

```sh
docker build -t your_dockerhub_username/sample-csi-plugin:latest .
```

Replace your_dockerhub_username with your actual Docker Hub username.

### Deploying the CSI Plugin

To deploy the CSI plugin on a Kubernetes cluster, apply the manifest files in the manifest directory:

```sh
kubectl apply -f manifest/
```

This will create all necessary resources (ServiceAccount, StorageClass, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding, Controller Plugin Deployment, and Secret) and deploy your sample CSI plugin on your Kubernetes cluster.

Now, these sections are updated to reflect your project structure and requirements.
